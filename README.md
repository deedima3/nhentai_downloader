# nhentai_downloader
My First Experiment on GUI App, an App that can download manga when nuclear code is given
This program uses:
- Eel
- Beaautiful Soup
## Program Feature
### Main Menu Preview

### Download all manga page on nhentai when given a code
![alt text](pictures/download.jpg?raw=true)  
The program uses beautifulsoup to get the page number of given manga and to get where the picture is saven. And use request to get the link and save the file.
### Preview the first page of the manga
![alt text](pictures/preview.jpg?raw=true)  
Same as download, this part uses beatifulsoup to get the url where the image is saved, and uses js to change the image
